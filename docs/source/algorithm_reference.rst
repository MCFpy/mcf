Algorithm Reference
=======================

Here you can find a detailed explanation of the core processes involved in the **mcf**. Key methods such as training, inference, local centering, and the use of :math:`CBGATEs` and :math:`BGATEs` of the Modified Causal Forest module are covered. Additionally, the Policy Tree algorithm used in the Optimal Policy module is presented.
