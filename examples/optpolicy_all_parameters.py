#  Parameters for discretization of features (necessary for 'Quantilized')

FAIR_PROTECTED_DISC_METHOD = None
#  Whether and how to perform the discretization for

#               estimated densities. The latter may become unreliable if their
#               dimension is not very small.
#  'EqualCell': Attempts to create equal cells for each feature. Maybe be

FAIR_MATERIAL_DISC_METHOD = None
#  Whether and how to perform the discretization for materially relevant

#  allowed is set by FAIR_MATERIAL_MAX_GROUPS.
#  'NoDiscretization': Variables are not changed. If one of the features has

#               materially relevant features will formally be treated as

#  Default (or None) is 'Kmeans'.

#  Level of discretization of variables (only if needed)
FAIR_PROTECTED_MAX_GROUPS = None
FAIR_MATERIAL_MAX_GROUPS = None
#  Number of different groups of values of features that are
#  materially relavant /protected (if discretization is used).
#  This is currently only necessary for 'Quantilized'.
#  Its meaning depends on fair_protected_disc_method, fair_material_disc_method:
#  If 'EqualCell': If more than 1 variable is included among the protected
#      features, this restriction is applied to each variable.
#  If 'Kmeans': This is the number of clusters used by Kmeans.
#  Default (or None) is 5.

#  Test for internally consistency.
FAIR_CONSISTENCY_TEST = None
#  The fairness corrections are applied independently to every policy score (
#  which usually is a potential outcome or an IATE(x) for each treatment
#  relative to some base treatment (i.e. comparing 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, etc.).
#  Thus the IATE for the 2-1 comparison can be computed as IATE(2-0)-IATE(1-0).
#  This tests compares two ways to compute a fair score for the 2-1 (and all
#  other comparisons) which should give simular results:
#  a) Difference of two fair (!) scores
#  b) Difference of corresponding scores, subsequently made fair.
#  Note: Depending on the number of treatments, this test may be computationally
#  more expensive than the orginal fairness corrections.
#  Therefore, the default is False.

# - - - - - - - - - - - -  Black-Box allocations - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#   The method 'best_policy_score' conducts Black-Box allocations.
#   'Black-Box allocations' are those that are obtained by using the scores
#   directly (potentially subject to restrictions).
#   When the Black-Box allocations are used for allocation of new data, the
#   respective scores must be available in the prediction data.
VAR_BB_RESTRICT_NAME = 'x_unord0'   # Variable name related to a restriction.
#   If there is a capacity constraint, preference will be given to obs. with
#   highest values of this variable. Default is that no such variable is used.

# - - - - - - - - -  Black-Box allocations based Classifier - - - - - - - - - -
#   The bps_classifier classifier algorithm runs a classifier for each of the
#   allocations obtained by the 'best_policy_score' algorithm. One
#   advantage compared of this approach compared to the
#   'best_policy_score' algorithm is that the prediction of the allocation
#   for new observations is fast as it does not require to recompute the
#   policy score (as it is case with the 'best_policy_score' algorithm).
#   The classifier is selected among four different classifiers offered by
#   sci-kit learn, namely a simple neural network, two classification
#   random forests with minimum leaf size of 2 and 5, and ADDABoost. The
#   selection is a made according to the out-of-sample performance on
#   scikit-learns Accuracy Score.

#   There no parameters specific to this method.

# - - - - - - - - - - - Optimal shallow decision trees - - - - - - - - - - - -
#   These decision trees are optimal trees, in the sense that all possible
#   trees are checked if they lead to a better performance. If restrictions
#   are specified, then this is incorporated into treatment specific cost
#   parameters (see below). They are calibrated by finding values that lead to
#   to desired capacity constraints with (unrestricted) Black-Box allocations
#   (as the latter are much, much faster to compute than decision trees).
#   Many ideas of the implementation follow Zhou, Athey, Wager (2022). If the
#   provided policy score fulfils their conditions (i.e., they use a doubly
#   robust double machine learning like score), then they also provide
#   attractive theoretical properties.

PT_DEPTH_TREE_1 = 2   # Depth of 1st optimal tree. Default is 3.
#   In this example, this parameter is set to 2 to speed up computation.

PT_DEPTH_TREE_2 = 2   # Depth of 2nd optimal tree. This set is built within
#   the strata obtained from the leaves of the first tree. If set to 0, a second
#   tree is not built. Default is 1 (together with the default for
#   pt_depth_tree_1 this leads to a (not optimal) total tree of level of 4.
#   In this example, this parameter is set to 2.

#   Note that tree depth is defined such that a depth of 1 implies 2 leaves,
#   a depth of 2 implies 4 leaves, a depth of = 3 implies 8 leaves, etc.

PT_NO_OF_EVALUPOINTS = None  # No of evaluation points for continuous variables.
#   The lower this value, the faster the algorithm, but it may also deviate
#   more from the optimal splitting rule. This parameter is closely related to
#   approximation parameter of Zhou, Athey, Wager (2022)(A) with
#   A =  # of observation / PT_NO_OF_EVALUPOINTS. Default is 100.

PT_EVA_CAT_MULT = None      # Changes the number of the evaluation points
#   (pt_no_of_evalupoints) for the unordered (categorical) variables to:
#   pt_eva_cat_mult * pt_no_of_evalupoints (available only for the method
#   'policy tree').  Default is 2.

PT_SELECT_VALUES_CAT = None   # Approximation method for larger categorical
#   variables.
#   Since we search among optimal trees, for categorical variables
#   variables we need to check for all possible combinations of the different
#   values that lead to binary splits. This number could be huge. There-
#   fore, we compare only PT_NO_OF_EVALUPOINTS * PT_EVA_CAT_MULT different
#   combinations.
#   Method 1 (PT_SELECT_VALUES_CAT == True) does this by randomly drawing
#   values from the particular categorical variable and forming groups only
#   using those values. Method 2 (PT_SELECT_VALUES_CAT==False) sorts the
#   values of the categorical variables according to the values of the policy
#   score as one would do for a standard random forest. If this set is still
#   too large, a random sample of the entailed combinations is drawn.
#   Method 1 is only available for the method 'policy tree'. The default is
#   False.

PT_MIN_LEAF_SIZE = None    # Minimum leaf size. Leaves that are smaller than
#   PT_MIN_LEAF_SIZE in the training data will not be considered. A larger
#   number reduces computation time and avoids some overfitting. Default is
#   0.1 x # of training observations / # of leaves (if treatment shares are
#   restricted this is multiplied by the smallest share allowed).

PT_ENFORCE_RESTRICTION = None
#   Enforces the imposed restriction (to some extent) during the
#   computation of the policy tree. This increases the quality of trees
#   concerning obeying restrictions, but can be very time consuming.
#   It will be automatically set to False if more than 1 policy tree is
#   estimated. Default is False.

#   correlated with each other. If yes, these variables are deleted.

#   smaller than this value will be deleted. Default is 10.

#   Tuple of size of number treatments. Sum of all elements must add to 1.
#   This used only used as a comparison in the evaluation of other allocations.

# -------------- Other parameters (costs and restrictions) --------------------
OTHER_MAX_SHARES = (1, 1, 0.3)  # Maximum share allowed for each treatment.
#   This is a tuple with as many elements as treatments.
#   0 <  OTHER_MAX_SHARES <= 1.  (1,...,1) implies unconstrained optimization
#   (default).

OTHER_COSTS_OF_TREAT = None   # Treatment specific costs. These costs
#   are directly subtracted from the policy scores. Therefore, they should be
#   measured in the same units as the scores. Default is 0.
#   If None, and when there are constraints, costs will be automatically
#   determined to  enforce constraints in the training data by finding
#   costs that lead to an allocation (not a tree, but chosing individually
#   best treatments by unconstrained Black-Box methods) that fulfils
#   restrictions in OTHER_MAX_SHARES.

OTHER_COSTS_OF_TREAT_MULT = None   # Multiplier of automatically determined
#   costs. None or Tuple of positive numbers with dimension equal to the number
#   of treatments. Default is (1, ..., 1).
#   Use only when automatic costs do not lead to a satisfaction of the
#   constraints given by OTHER_MAX_SHARES. This allows to increase (>1) or
#   decrease (<1) the share of treated in particular treatment.
