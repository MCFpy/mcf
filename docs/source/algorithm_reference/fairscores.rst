Fairness Extensions in OptimalPolicy
===========================================

The OptimalPolicy class in the mcf module includes experimental features for fairness adjustments. 
These features are designed to ensure that policy scores are fair with respect to certain protected variables. 
The fairness adjustments are based on the work by Bearth, Lechner, Mareckova, and Muny (2024).

These features are designed to ensure that policy scores are fair with respect to certain protected variables.
The fairness adjustments are based on the work by Bearth, Lechner, Mareckova, and Muny (2024).

This method can be configured using several parameters to control the type and extent of fairness adjustments. 
Specifically, allowing users to specify the type of fairness adjustment, the method for discretizing features, and the number of groups for discretization. 

These features are experimental.
