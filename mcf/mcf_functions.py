        causal heterogeneity. They will be discretized (and dependening
        p_gates_smooth) also treated as continuous. If not already included

        causal heterogeneity. If not already included in var_x_name_ord,
        they will be added to the list of features.
        Default is None.

    var_y_tree_name : String or List of string (or None), optional

        relevant if multiple outcome variables are specified in var_y_name.
        Only relevant for :meth:`~ModifiedCausalForest.train` method.
        Default is None.

    cf_alpha_reg_grid : Integer (or None), optional
        Minimum remaining share when splitting leaf: Number of grid values.

        estimation of objective function.
        Default (or None) is 1.

    cf_alpha_reg_max : Float (or None), optional
        Minimum remaining share when splitting leaf: Largest value of
        grid (keep it below 0.2).
        Default (or None) is 0.15.

    cf_boot : Integer (or None), optional
        Number of Causal Trees.
        Default (or None) is 1000.

    cf_chunks_maxsize : Integer (or None), optional
        For large samples, randomly split the training data into equally sized
        chunks, train a forest in each chunk, and estimate effects for each
        forest. Final effect estimates are obtained by averaging effects
        obtained for each forest. This procedures improves scalability by
        reducing computation time (at the possible price of a somewhat larger
        finite sample bias).
        If cf_chunks_maxsize is larger than the sample size, there is no random
        splitting.
        The default (None) is dependent on the size of the training data:
        If there are less than 90'000 training observations: No splitting.
        Otherwise:
        
        .. math::
        
            \\text{cf_chunks_maxsize} = 90000 + \\frac{{(\\text{number of observations} - 90000)^{0.8}}}{{(\\text{# of treatments} - 1)}}

        Default is None.

    cf_compare_only_to_zero : Boolean (or None), optional
       If True, the computation of the MCE ignores all elements not
       related to the first treatment (which usually is the control group). This
       speeds up computation, should give better effect estimates, and may
       be attractive when interest is only in the comparisons of each
       treatment to the control group and not among each other. This may also
       be attractive for optimal policy analysis based on using estimated
       potential outcomes normalized by the estimated potential outcome of the
       control group (i.e., IATEs of treatments vs. control group).
       Default (or None) is False.

    cf_n_min_grid : Integer (or None), optional
        Minimum leaf size: Number of grid values.
        If grid is used, optimal value is determined by out-of-bag

        Default (or None) is 1.

    cf_n_min_max : Integer (or None), optional
        Minimum leaf size: Largest minimum leaf size.
        If None :

        .. math::

            \\text{A} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\text{number of observations in the smallest treatment group}}^{0.5}}{10}, \\text{at least 2} 

        :math:`\\text{cf_n_min_max} = \\text{round}(A \\times \\text{number of treatments})`
        Default is None.

    cf_n_min_min : Integer (or None), optional
        Minimum leaf size: Smallest minimum leaf size.
        If None:

        .. math::

            \\text{A} = \\text{number of observations in smallest treatment group}^{0.4} / 10, \\text{at least 1.5} 

        :math:`\\text{cf_n_min_min} = \\text{round}(A \\times \\text{number of treatments})`
        Default is None.

    cf_n_min_treat : Integer (or None), optional
        Minimum number of observations per treatment in leaf.
        A higher value reduces the risk that a leaf cannot be filled with
        outcomes from all treatment arms in the evaluation subsample.
        There is no grid based tuning for this parameter.
        This parameter impacts the minimum leaf size which will be at least
        to :math:`\\text{n_min_treat} \\times \\text{number of treatments}`
        None :

        .. math::

            \\frac{\\frac{{\\text{n_min_min}} + {\\text{n_min_max}}}{2}}{\\text{number of treatments} \\times 10}, \\text{at least 1} 

        Default is None.

        Choice of method of nearest neighbour matching.
        True : Prognostic scores. False: Inverse of covariance matrix of
        features.
        Default (or None) is True.

    cf_nn_main_diag_only : Boolean (or None), optional
        Nearest neighbour matching: Use main diagonal of covariance matrix
        only. Only relevant if match_nn_prog_score == False.
        Default (or None) is False.

    cf_m_grid : Integer (or None), optional
        Number of variables used at each new split of tree: Number of grid
        values.
        If grid is used, optimal value is determined by out-of-bag
        estimation of objective function.
        Default (or None) is 1.

    cf_m_random_poisson : Boolean (or None), optional
        Number of variables used at each new split of tree:
        True : Number of randomly selected variables is stochastic for each
        split, drawn from a Poisson distribution. Grid gives mean
        value of 1 + poisson distribution (m-1) (m is determined by
        cf_m_share parameters).
        False : No additional randomisation.
        Default (or None) is True.

    cf_m_share_max : Float (or None), optional
        Share of variables used at each new split of tree: Maximum.
        Default (or None) is 0.6.
        If variables randomly selected for splitting do not show any variation
        in leaf considered for splitting, then all variables will be used for
        that split.

    cf_m_share_min : Float (or None), optional
        Share of variables used at each new split of tree: Minimum.
        Default (or None) is 0.1.
        If variables randomly selected for splitting do not show any variation
        in leaf considered for splitting, then all variables will be used for
        that split.

    cf_mce_vart : Integer (or None), optional
        Splitting rule for tree building:
        0 : mse's of regression only considered.
        1 : mse+mce criterion (default).
        2 : -var(effect): heterogeneity maximising splitting rule of
        Wager & Athey (2018).
        3 : randomly switching between outcome-mse+mce criterion
        & penalty functions.
        Default (or None) is 1.

    cf_p_diff_penalty : Integer (or None), optional
            Penalty function (depends on the value of `mce_vart`).
    
        `mce_vart == 0`
            Irrelevant (no penalty).
    
        `mce_vart == 1`
            Multiplier of penalty (in terms of `var(y)`).
            0 : No penalty.
            None :
    
            .. math::
    
                \\frac{2 \\times (\\text{n} \\times \\text{subsam_share})^{0.9}}{\\text{n} \\times \\text{subsam_share}} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{no_of_treatments} \\times (\\text{no_of_treatments} - 1)}{2}}
    
        `mce_vart == 2`
            Multiplier of penalty (in terms of MSE(y) value function without splits) for penalty.  
            0 : No penalty.
            None :
    
            .. math::
    
                \\frac{100 \\times 4 \\times (n \\times \\text{f_c.subsam_share})^{0.8}}{n \\times \\text{f_c.subsam_share}}
    
    cf_penalty_type : String (or None), optional
        Type of penalty function.
        'mse_d':  MSE of treatment prediction in daughter leaf (new in 0.7.0)
        'diff_d': Penalty as squared leaf difference (as in Lechner, 2018)
        Note that an important advantage of 'mse_d' that it can also be used
        for tuning (due to its computation, this is not possible for 'diff_d').
        Default (or None) is 'mse_d'.

    cf_random_thresholds : Integer (or None), optional
        Use only a random selection of values for splitting (continuous
        feature only; re-randomize for each splitting decision; fewer
        thresholds speeds up programme but may lead to less accurate
        results).
        0 : No random thresholds.
        > 0 : Number of random thresholds used for ordered variables.
        None :

    cf_subsample_factor_forest : Float (or None), optional
        Multiplier of default size of subsampling sample (S) used to build
        tree.

        .. math::

            S = \\max((n^{0.5},min(0.67 n, \\frac{2 \\times (n^{0.85})}{n}))), \\text{n: # of training observations} 

        :math:`S \\times \\text{cf_subsample_factor_forest}, \\text{is not larger than 80%.}` 
        Default (or None) is 1.

    cf_subsample_factor_eval : Float or Boolean (or None), optional
        Size of subsampling sample used to populate tree.
        False: No subsampling in evaluation subsample.
        True or None: :math:(2 \\times \\text{subsample size}) used for
            tree building (to avoid too many empty leaves).
        Float (>0): Multiplier of subsample size used for tree building.
        In particular for larger samples, using subsampling in evaluation
        will speed up computations and reduces demand on memory.
        Tree-specific subsampling in evaluation sample increases speed
        at which the asymtotic bias disappears (at the expense of a slower
        disappearance of the variance; however, simulations so far show no
        relevant impact).
        Default is None.

    cf_tune_all : Boolean (or None), optional
        Tune all parameters. If True, all *_grid keywords will be set to 3.

        Variable importance for causal forest computed by permuting
        single variables and comparing share of increase in objective
        function of mcf (computed with out-of-bag data).

        Common support adjustment: Method.
        0 : No common support adjustment.

        1 : Min-max rules for probabilities in treatment subsamples.
        2 : Enforce minimum and maximum probabilities for all obs
        all but one probability.
        Observations off support are removed. Out-of-bag predictions
        are used to avoid overfitting (which would lead to a too
        large reduction in the number of observations).
        Default (or None) is 1.

    cs_adjust_limits : Float (or None), optional
        Common support adjustment: Accounting for multiple treatments.
        None :
        :math:`(\\text{number of treatments} - 2) \\times 0.05`
        If cs_type > 0:
        :math:`\\text{upper limit} \\times = 1 + \\text{support_adjust_limits}`,
        :math:`\\text{lower limit} \\times = 1 - \\text{support_adjust_limits}`.
        The restrictiveness of the common support criterion increases with
        the number of treatments. This parameter allows to reduce this
        restrictiveness.
        Default is None.

    cs_max_del_train : Float (or None), optional
        Common support adjustment: If share of observations in training
        data used that are off support is larger than cs_max_del_train
        (0-1), an exception is raised. In this case, user should change
        input data.
        Default (or None) is 0.5.

    cs_min_p : Float (or None), optional
        Common support adjustment: If cs_type == 2, observations are
        deleted if :math:`p(d=m|x)` is less or equal than cs_min_p for at least
        one treatment. Default (or None) is 0.01.

    cs_quantil : Float (or None), optional
        Common support adjustment: How to determine upper and lower bounds.
        If CS_TYPE == 1: 1 or None : Min-max rule.

        Default (or None) is 1.

    ct_grid_dr : Integer (or None), optional

        continuous part of treatment) for dose response function.
        Default (or None) is 100.

    ct_grid_nn : Integer (or None), optional
        Number of grid point for discretization of continuous treatment
        (with 0 mass point; grid is defined in terms of quantiles of

        Default (or None) is 10.

    ct_grid_w : Integer (or None), optional
        Number of grid point for discretization of continuous treatment
        (with 0 mass point; grid is defined in terms of quantiles of
        continuous part of treatment) for weights.
        Default (or None) is 10.

    dc_clean_data : Boolean (or None), optional
        Clean covariates. Remove all rows with missing observations and
        unnecessary variables from DataFrame.
        Default (or None) is True.

    dc_check_perfectcorr : Boolean (or None), optional
        Screen and clean covariates: Variables that are perfectly
        correlated with each others will be deleted.
        Default (or None) is True.

    dc_min_dummy_obs : Integer (or None), optional
        Screen covariates: If > 0 dummy variables with
        less than dc_min_dummy_obs observations in one category will be
        deleted. Default (or None) is 10.

    dc_screen_covariates : Boolean (or None), optional
        Screen and clean covariates.
        Default (or None) is True.

    fs_yes : Boolean (or None), optional
        Feature selection before building causal forest: A feature is
        deleted if it is irrelevant in the reduced forms for the treatment
        AND the outcome. Reduced forms are computed with random forest
        classifiers or random forest regression, depending on the type of
        variable. Irrelevance is measured by variable importance measures
        based on randomly permuting a single variable and checking its
        reduction in either accuracy (classification) or R2 (regression)
        compared to the test set prediction based on the full model.

        is larger than 0.5, one of the two variables is kept.
        (ii) Variables used to compute GATEs, BGATEs, CBGATEs.
        Variables contained in 'var_x_name_remain_ord'
        or 'var_x_name_remain_unord', or are needed otherwise, are not removed.
        If the number of variables is very large (and the space of
        relevant features is much sparser, then using feature selection is
        likely to improve computational and statistical properties of the
        mcf etimator).
        Default (or None) is False.

    fs_rf_threshold : Integer or Float (or None), optional
        Feature selection: Threshold in terms of relative loss of variable
        importance in %.
        Default (or None) is 1.

    fs_other_sample : Boolean (or None), optional
        True : Random sample from training data used. These
        observations will not be used for causal forest.
        False : Use the same sample as used for causal forest estimation.
        Default (or None) is True.

    fs_other_sample_share : Float (or None), optional
        Feature selection: Share of sample used for feature selection
        (only relevant if fs_other_sample is True).

        Type of treatment. 'discrete': Discrete treatment.

        Default (or None) is 'discrete'.

        Additionally, compute more efficient IATE (IATE are estimated twice
        and averaged where role of tree_building and tree_filling sample is
        exchanged; X-fitting). No inference is attempted for these
        parameters.
        Default (or None) is False.

    gen_mp_parallel : Integer (or None), optional
        Number of parallel processes (using ray on CPU). The smaller this
        value is, the slower the programme, the smaller its demands on RAM.
        None : 80% of logical cores.
        Default is None.

    gen_outfiletext : String (or None), optional
        File for text output. (\*.txt) file extension will be added.
        None : 'txtFileWithOutput'.
        Default is None.

        Path were the output is written too (text, estimated effects, etc.)
