# mcf - Modified Causal Forests

The Python package **mcf** implements the Modified Causal Forest introduced by [Lechner (2018)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1812.09487). This package allows you to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects for binary and multiple treatments from experimental or observational data. Additionally, mcf offers the capability to learn optimal policy allocations.
