Algorithm Reference
=======================

The algorithm reference offers a detailed explanation of the core processes of the **mcf**. It covers the key methods such as training, inference, local centering, and the use of :math:`CBGATEs` and :math:`BGATEs` of the Modified Causal Forest module. Additionally, it explores the Policy Tree algorithm used in the Optimal Policy module.
