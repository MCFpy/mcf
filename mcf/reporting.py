class McfOptPolReport:
    """
        Provides reports about the main specification choices and most
        important results of the :class:`~mcf_functions.ModifiedCausalForest`
        and :class:`~optpolicy_functions.OptimalPolicy` estimations.

    Parameters
    ----------
        mcf : Instance of the ModifiedCausalForest class or None, optional
            Contains all information needed for reports. The default is None.

        mcf_sense : Instance of the ModifiedCausalForest class or None, optional
            Contains all information from sensitivity analysis needed for
            reports. The default is None.

        optpol : Instance of the OptimalPolicy class or None, optional
            Contains all information from the optimal policy analysis needed
            for reports. The default is None.

        outputpath : String, Pathlib object, or None, optional
            Path to write the pdf file that is created with the
            :meth:`~McfOptPolReport.report` method. If None, then an
            '/out' subdirectory of the current working directory is used.
            If the latter does not exist, it is created.

        outputfile : String or None, optional
            Name of the pdf file that is created by the
            :meth:`~McfOptPolReport.report` method. If None, 'Reporting' is
            used as name. Any name will always appended by string that contains
            the day and time (measured when the programme ends).

    Attributes
    ----------

    version : String
        Version of mcf module used to create the instance.

        Content from optimal policy allocation to compute reports.

    sens_o : Dictionary
        Content from sensitivity analysis to compute reports.

    blind_o : Dictionary
        Content from partially blinded IATE estimation to compute reports.

    text : Dictionary
        Container for text to compute reports.

    mcf : Boolean
        True if there is anything to report about mcf estimation.

    opt : Boolean
        True if there is anything to report about optimal policy allocation.

    sens : Boolean
        True if there is anything to report about sensitivity analysis.

    blind : Boolean.
        True if there is anything to report about blinded IATE estimation.

    iv : Boolean.
        True if instrumental variable estimation is performed.
